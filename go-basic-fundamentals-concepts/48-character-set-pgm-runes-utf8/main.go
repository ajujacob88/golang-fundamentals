	//var char byte = '‚úä' //not possible, because it is 3 byte long, so it overflows the byte variable
	var char1 rune = '‚úä'
	var char2 int = '‚úä'
	char3 := '‚úä' //default type of a rune literal is rune type
	char4 := 'üôè'
	fmt.Println(char1, char2, char3, char4)

	//so in summary, usiong utf 8 we can reprent code point between 1 bytes and 4 bytes,, so i can store these code byte in a rune variable.
	//you can represent any unicode code point using the rune type because it can store 4 bytes of data(since rune is int 32),, so if you want to represent any unicode code point you can use the rune type and rune literal because it can store upto 4 bytes
